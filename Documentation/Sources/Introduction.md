## Introduction
Morse is a plugin for Unreal Engine that enables the development of software based on a data-centric architecture using the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard.

DDS, specified by the Object Management Group (OMG), is a standard designed for reliable data distribution in distributed environments. The Morse plugin also supports the Interface Definition Language (IDL) wich is also an OMG standart, allowing definitions of the data types being exchanged between sofware component.

This plugin simplifies the integration of Unreal Engine into distributed systems by facilitating seamless data sharing between different software components. Additionally, it offers a modular architecture that allows data models to be added as third-party plugins.
