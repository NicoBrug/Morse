Morse is a plugin for Unreal Engine designed to facilitate interoperability between Unreal Engine and external systems. It simplifies the definition and exchange of information, aiding in the integration of Unreal Engine within distributed architectures.

It utilizes the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard specified by the Object Management Group (OMG) to ensure reliable communication across various platforms. It also employs the Interface Definition Language (IDL) standard, also defined by the OMG, to support the specification of data types and structures.

This plugin enables developers to connect Unreal Engine to external systems, allowing for effective data sharing and collaboration in distributed environments.
